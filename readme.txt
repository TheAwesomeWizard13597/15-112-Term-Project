README

Files can be run on download. Map Seed can be any combination of numbers or letters. May crash on map load. If it crashes, relaunch (issue is with the random number generator). 

Controls are WASD to move. E is for special attack. If you press E, you must mouseclick to use special attack. Character 0 (red) special attack is a flash, teleporting a short distance towards mousepress. Character 1 (Brown) special attack is a freeze, freezing all enemies in a short radius. 

Press c to change characters, and click on the character. IMPORTANT: As of 12/8, the attack animation of the brown character is not completed, and the program will crash if you attack with her. This is intended as a proof of concept and will be completed as soon as possible. 

Press x to open the crafting menu. Press i to open the inventory. Pause menu is activated with Escape. Keybind change is not implemented, although full controls can be found there. Press escape to leave keybind menu and pause menu. Press ` to open developer/debug mode. IMPORTANT: If you activate a UI, make sure you deactivate it by pressing the same toggle key before activating another. Activating more than one UI simultaneously will result in major bugs. 

Mouseclick to attack. Adam (Final boss) is located on the bottom right corner of the map at coordinates (0, 0). Please do not attempt to fight him and think you can win. He is a very difficult boss fight, especially with only one functional character. 

Press b to open the build menu. You can only build on the spawn chunk. If the build menu does not open, try moving over a chunk, as you may not be in the correct on. This is an intentional game feature. 

If you die and choose to respawn, your inventory will be wiped. This is an intentional game feature. Similarly, if you manage to defeat Adam and continue the game, your inventory will be wiped. 

Two bars are shown on the gameplay UI. The top purple bar shows the cooldown of your abilities. The bottom red bar shows your current health. 

Additional bugs should be reported to theawesomewizard13597@gmail.com. 

To verify any of the information, turn on godmode in the developer menu. This will make it so that you are invincible.
